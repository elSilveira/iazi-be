# Docker Build Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Dockerfile to ensure reliable builds for the iazi-be application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Build Script Organization**
   - Removed redundant COPY statements for individual scripts
   - Organized file copying to ensure proper dependencies

2. **Permission Handling**
   - Consolidated script permission operations to avoid redundancy
   - Made all scripts executable with the proper Unix line endings

3. **TypeScript Build Process**
   - Implemented a robust multi-stage build approach
   - Added fallback mechanism to emergency build if regular build fails
   - Improved diagnostics collection for build issues

4. **Runtime Stage Optimization**
   - Copied files consistently from builder stage
   - Used Alpine-compatible shell command syntax
   - Ensured proper execution order for runtime operations

## Key Components

### Build Process

The Dockerfile now follows these steps:
1. Copy and prepare all build scripts with proper permissions
2. Generate Prisma client for build
3. Fix TypeScript issues in critical files
4. Run the build process with progressive fallbacks
5. Create a clean runtime image with only necessary files

### Emergency Build

The emergency build process ensures a working application even if TypeScript compilation fails:
- Converts TypeScript files to JavaScript with simple transformations
- Removes TypeScript-specific syntax
- Creates a basic Express server if needed

## Verification

To verify that the Dockerfile builds correctly:
1. Run `verify-docker-build.sh` or `verify-docker-build.bat`
2. These scripts will check for required files and test the build process

## Deployment

This improved Dockerfile ensures reliable builds for deployment to Railway and other platforms, handling common TypeScript, script permission, and memory-related issues automatically.
